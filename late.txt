
Late Poem

Bus climbs 
feet try 
lungs cry
thoughts race.

Red light 
Flash of hope
blurry sight
sharper slope. 

Doors open
heavy sigh
phone out 
up all nigh' 

Empty 
stomach 
brain
on strike

Forbes and 
Morewood
soul sacri- 
ficial site.

Cut through
traffic 
wandering
how the 
fuck 

I'm still alive.  
Late
again  
final stretch

bleeding time
can't hesi-
tate.
Run to 

Hunt 
up the stairs 
run to 
Baker 

steal the air
get to class
take rest
in chair.

Bus climbs 
feet try 
lungs cry
thoughts race.
