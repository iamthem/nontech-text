Anger eats away 
comes back 
recurs 

bounces in echo chambers
tears apart the soul 

Gripping hate 
Fuck you hate 

Stab in the back hate 
Cut off your balls hate 

That scene in *The Irishman* hate 
The shit that sticks with you for life 

Pathetic angry men 
Viejo arrugaos 

Que nunca salieron del cucoon 

Larvae 

Whacked 

Scorcesse takes advantage of the whole ludicry 
with some black ass humor 

DeNiro kills his friend 
whacks him himself 

*Old men delight in giving good advice as a consolation for the
fact that they can no longer set bad examples.*

~ La Rouchefoucauld 

Networking for dummies 

*New guy*

Cause of death as the characters are introduced completely genius

*When I ask somebody to take of something, I expect them to do it themselves 
I don't need two roads coming back to me* 

Violence of the body is the same as of the mind 

All made of the same things 

*Whenever anybody says they're a little concerned, 
They're very concerned*

They exist for the market 

Flesh for sale 

For the basic instinct, 

the rush in the veins 

But still people underneath 

Human beings that shit and cheat 

No matter how cheeky their smiles 

and round their tits 

skinny their waist 

A journey mass produced 

Optimized 

Optimal skin showing 

Thinnest possible cloth 

Moves millions 

Man loves to be led
