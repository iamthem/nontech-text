Haikus: 

What thirsts in my soul -- 
Lost, in an alien landscape
Longing for purpose. 

Steep volcanic rock 
shielding a village from tempest.
Born in the ocean.

Don't forget -- to breath. 
You pompous insect, from 
a forgotten planet. 


Going Under 

Rattling -- 
muscles panic: 
Why does it burn? 

Weeping -- 
wind pierces straight 
through my coat

Freezing -- 
fire ablaze 
within the forest 

Thinking -- 
thoughts flicker; fried 
Grey matter. 

Winding -- 
steps ascend, 
Imagined reality 

Dreaming -- 
neon / tribal
colors / sounds

Delusions of -- 


Crossing -- 
asphalt river 
warping time

Of -- 

Eating -- 
sugar grenade 
(Ultimate Brownie)

Delusions of -- 

Laughing -- 
from booth to booth
hugs and giggles 

Of -- 

Beep-booping -- 
below ground, my 
beloved dungeon -- 
can't be found. 

Delusions of warmth.
