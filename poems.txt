Just another Friday 

    Were you expecting something more contrived? 
        
        Are you reading in my voice
                        
                            These markings are just minuscule dots

        supposed to represent  
                            
                            how you and I

            But what do words say  
                why           are        --complicated airflow
                              feel       as well
                                        
Umberto Eco says 

    Two things 
    You resound in valleys 


Draft 

    Every directive  
    ploys its negative 

    Retreating tide  
    exposing shore 

    Unsure of whether 
    to play a tune or 
    let silence stir 
    
    Direction supports
    like Earth supports

Regarding the Character of my Father

    Exceeding feeding ceiling 
    feeling healing stealin 
    callao doblao venao celao 
    guayao casao 

    what is a poetic identity 
    do words come from somewhere 

    a medium that feels forced 
    Typing does not mix well with poetry 

    Unless you switch that bitch up 
    Goyo in da House 

    Expectation weighs me down 
    Desire breeds jealousy and Co. 

    Bring that ass here hoe 
    
    lower the keyboard and tune in 

    Simulator you piece of shit 

    giving your ass away 

    dropping alota frames  

    Write stanzas 
    plant seeds 

    stay cool everyone 

    Plagiarize these fucks.
    al pasar un tiempo fuera 
    del cubículo 
    nos alejamos del regimen 
    come dice el refrán 
    
    Modernity is one mixed bag 
    accidents happen 
    not to those that work for them 

    A rhythm of lure 
    The Shakira of stanzas 

    Faint murmur chattering 
    unlike the likely culprit 

    Creation is a feedback loop 
    Heroes commit often 
    their work never forgotten 

    Modernity is spending your day at a keyboard 
    space you inhabit 
    inhabits you

    Convengo con mi terror
    de la expectativa de una variable 
    aleatoria con cola occidental 
    pesada, inconcebible catástrofe
